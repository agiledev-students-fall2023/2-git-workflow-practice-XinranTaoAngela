What I find interesting about this article is its comprehensive overview of the software engineering career path, from entry-level positions to advanced roles like principal engineer or technical director. It provides valuable insights into the potential earnings at each career stage, which can be motivating for those considering this field.

Additionally, the inclusion of real-life success stories and youtube videos demonstrates the diverse paths a person can take to enter the software engineering/ developer field, whether through formal education or self study. The article's emphasis on the continued growth of software engineering roles highlights the long-term career prospects and the increasing demand for software engineers, making it a compelling career choice for those interested in technology.

This article made me stress about my future after college, but also provided valuable information and sucess stories to show that it is not out of reach to get a career in software engineering. I think the job market is something that changes a lot and might not be in the best place right now, but this article induced some hope along with some anxiety. 

The article also gives what is currently and in the future may be in demand, such as artificial intellegence software engineer and machine learning.
